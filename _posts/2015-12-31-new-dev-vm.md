I finally made the jump and started using Windows 10. I have been back doing some web development and I wanted to make sure I had the latest of everything so that I wasn't upgrading in the middle of a project. My main computer is an old MacBook Pro, so this meant rebuilding my Windows Dev VM.

### The new build:

1. Windows 10 (free*)
2. Sql Server 2014 (Express with Tools)
3. Visual Studio 2015 Community (free)
4. ASP.NET 5 (free)
5. ShutUp10 (free)
6. JDK 1.8 (free)
7. IntelliJ Idea Community (free)

I decided to try ShutUp10 after setting all of my own privacy settings. No installation required, just download and run. The defult settings are not quite as secure as I would like, so I changed things around and exported my settings to move over to my gaming PC. I have since talked my dad into running this and using my settings as well.

First thing I am going to do is test out the ASP.NET 5 template for Single Page Application with AngularJS.  

Stay tuned!
